# bamazon
**How to run this app:** 
This app runs in the terminal window. 

**Usage:** >node bamazonCustomer.js | node bamazonManager.js 

**Summary:**
Bamazon has two user levels-Customer and Manager. The Customer level will display a list of items for purchase and will prompt the user to choose the product they wish to buy and the second specifies how many units. Once the user has requested the item, the app will check to ensure there are enough units in stock. It will then notify the user if there is insufficient inventory or provide the user with an invoice and update the database to reflect the new inventory level.

The second level is for Management. The Manager level allows the user to view the products for sale, to see products that are low in inventory, to add inventory to a given product, and to add new products to the database.
